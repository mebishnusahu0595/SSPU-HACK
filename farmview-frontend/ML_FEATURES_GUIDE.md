## 🧠 ML Algorithm Details

### Risk Factors Analyzed

1. **Waterlogging Risk** (0-10 scale)
   - Rainfall intensity
   - Soil drainage capacity
   - Crop sensitivity
   - Growth stage vulnerability
   - **Example**: Wheat + 150mm rain + Clay soil = HIGH RISK

2. **Drought Risk** (0-10 scale)
   - Low rainfall
   - High temperature
   - Irrigation type (Drip/Sprinkler/Rainfed)
   - Crop water requirements
   - **Example**: Rice + 0mm rain + 38°C + Rainfed = CRITICAL

3. **Heat Stress** (0-10 scale)
   - Temperature vs optimal range
   - Humidity amplification
   - Crop heat tolerance
   - **Example**: Tomato + 42°C + 85% humidity = SEVERE

4. **Cold Stress** (0-10 scale)
   - Temperature below optimal
   - Frost danger (< 5°C)
   - Crop cold tolerance
   - **Example**: Cotton + 2°C = FROST DANGER

5. **Disease Risk** (0-10 scale)
   - High humidity + rain + moderate temp
   - Fungal disease conditions
   - **Example**: Potato + 90% humidity + 25°C + rain = HIGH DISEASE RISK

6. **Wind Damage** (0-10 scale)
   - Wind speed thresholds
   - Crop stage vulnerability
   - **Example**: Maize (flowering) + 65 km/h winds = SEVERE RISK

### Overall Risk Calculation

```
Overall Risk = (
  Waterlogging × 0.20 +
  Drought × 0.20 +
  Heat Stress × 0.15 +
  Cold Stress × 0.15 +
  Disease Risk × 0.15 +
  Wind Damage × 0.15
) + Forecast Risks
```

**Risk Levels**:
- 0-2: Normal (Green)
- 2-4: Low (Yellow)
- 4-6: Medium (Orange)
- 6-8: High (Red)
- 8-10: Critical (Dark Red)

### Confidence Score

The ML algorithm calculates prediction confidence (0-1 scale) based on:
- Agreement between different risk factors
- Data quality and completeness
- Historical pattern matching

## 🔄 How It Works

### Step 1: Farmer Adds Land
```
Farmer draws polygon on map
→ Selects crop type (e.g., Wheat)
→ Adds soil type, irrigation method
→ Submits property
```

### Step 2: Automatic Weather Fetch
```
System extracts center coordinates (lat, lon)
→ Calls OpenWeatherMap API
→ Fetches current weather + 5-day forecast
→ Stores weather data
```

### Step 3: ML Analysis
```
ML algorithm analyzes:
- Crop type: Wheat
- Current weather: 5°C, 120mm rain, 85% humidity
- Forecast: More rain expected
- Soil: Clay (poor drainage)
- Growth stage: Flowering

→ Calculates 6 risk factors
→ Overall Risk: 8.5/10 (CRITICAL)
```

### Step 4: Alert Generation
```
Risk ≥ 5 → Create Alert
- Alert Type: Heavy Rainfall Warning + Frost Alert
- Severity: Critical
- Message: "🌧️ HEAVY RAIN + ❄️ FROST WARNING!"
- Recommendations:
  1. Improve drainage immediately
  2. Implement frost protection NOW
  3. Stop irrigation
```

### Step 5: Background Monitoring
```
Cron job runs every 6 hours
→ Checks all farmer properties
→ Fetches latest weather
→ Re-runs ML predictions
→ Creates new alerts if risks detected
→ Auto-deactivates expired alerts
```

## 🎯 ML Model Training (Future Enhancement)

Current system uses **rules-based ML** with agricultural research data. For advanced predictions, you can train a proper ML model:

### Data Collection
```javascript
// Store actual outcomes for training
{
  date: "2025-01-15",
  location: { lat: 28.6139, lon: 77.2090 },
  cropType: "Wheat",
  weather: { temp: 5, rain: 120, humidity: 85 },
  predictedRisk: 8.5,
  actualOutcome: "Severe damage - 40% crop loss",
  damageType: "Waterlogging + Frost"
}
```

### Model Improvement Loop
1. Collect weather + crop outcome data
2. Train ML model (Python: TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
3. Deploy model API
4. Replace rules-based logic with trained model
5. Continuous learning from farmer feedback

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **High Risk Scenarios to Test**:
   - Wheat + 150mm rain + Clay soil = Waterlogging
   - Rice + 0mm rain + 40°C = Drought
   - Tomato + 42°C = Heat stress
   - Cotton + 2°C = Frost danger

2. **Growth Stages Matter**:
   - Flowering stage is most vulnerable
   - Adjust predictions based on crop age

3. **Soil Type Impact**:
   - Clay soil = Poor drainage = Higher waterlogging risk
   - Sandy soil = Good drainage = Higher drought risk

4. **Irrigation Reduces Risk**:
   - Drip irrigation reduces drought risk by 80%
   - Rainfed farming has highest drought vulnerability
